The following will be our project for the next month or so.

Objective:
- Create a pdf parser.
- Perform content analysis on pdfs. Can be limited to summary generation, or picking out the most relevant words.
- Create a site where user can upload a pdf to view the summary.
- Also, provide a feature for the user to search for a keyword, and get the most relevant pdfs, amongst all that were uploaded by the user.
